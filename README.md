# Discrete calulator
This is an application that is used to automate processes in my discrete mathematics class. It contains two functions, a Euclidean Algorithm function that takes two values and outputs the greatest common denominator and the least common multiple. The second function is a base calulator that takes any number and converts it to a new number using an user input as a base. Both functions can be used multiple times while open and show the mathematical steps that were taken to calculate the output.
